# History of Computer Viruses and Worms

![Alt text](image.png)


With the start of the Internet in the late 1960s, known then as the ARPANET came a need to secure the data, connections, and computer systems for those using it; mostly research institutions, universities, and governments. Computers in the early days of the Internet often didn’t have basic protection and used telephone modems to dial-into the network. Highlights of memorable computer viruses and worms include:

- 1968 - Development of the ARPANET (early Internet)
- 1971 - First reported computer worm - Creeper
         - It didn't affect any computer but it displays message on screen stating,"I am a creeper , catch me if you can"
- 1986 - Brain MS-DOS virus
- 1989 - Morris Worm - Internet Denial of Service
- 2000 - ILOVEYOU Worm  ( written in VB script using social engineering infected millions within hour of realese)
- 2010 - Stuxnet

# Security Trends

* **Phishing**: A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a web site, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. <br><br>
* **Malware**: Software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized process that will have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system. A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host. Spyware and some forms of adware are also examples of malicious code.  <br><br>
* **Ransomware**: A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.  <br><br>
* **Business Email Compromise**: An exploit in which an attacker obtains access to a business email account and imitates the owner's identity, in order to defraud the company and its employees, customers or partners.  <br><br>
* **Internet of Things**: The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.

From the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report:

- 70% of attacks were perpetrated by outsiders and 34% involved internal actors.
- 45% of breaches featured Hacking, 22% included social attacks, and 17% involved malware. 86% of the breaches were financially motivated
- 72% of victims were large businesses and 28% were small businesses. <br>
***Even though these values change over time, the general concepts have remained steady. Take time to understand this report as it's used throughout the cybersecurity industry.***
