With the start of the Internet in the late 1960s, known then as the ARPANET came a need to secure the data, connections, and computer systems for those using it; mostly research institutions, universities, and governments. Computers in the early days of the Internet often didn’t have basic protection and used telephone modems to dial-into the network. Highlights of memorable computer viruses and worms include:

- 1968 - Development of the ARPANET (early Internet)
- 1971 - First reported computer worm - Creeper
         - It didn't affect any computer but it displays message on screen stating,"I am a creeper , catch me if you can"
- 1986 - Brain MS-DOS virus
- 1989 - Morris Worm - Internet Denial of Service
- 2000 - ILOVEYOU Worm  ( written in VB script using social engineering infected millions within hour of realese)
- 2010 - Stuxnet
